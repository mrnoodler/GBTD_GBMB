# GBTD_GBMB
GBTD/GBMB rebuild and fix

Original sources were taken here: http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html
Converted to delphi5 (the oldest i have) and re-built.

The initial purpose of doing this - making GBDK export compatible with 
GBDK-2020.

// Why not provide installation/ build instructions, many of us are not advanced enough to know what to do with a bunch of random files
